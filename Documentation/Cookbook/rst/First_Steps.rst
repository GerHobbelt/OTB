First Steps
===========

You can install and use OTB via 3 different methods :

    - the standalone package
    - the docker image
    - building from source

MacOS support will be deprecated in OTB > 8 because the Toolbox cannot be compiled natively on ARM (Apple Silicon) architecture.
We recommend using the docker image which works perfectly on both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures
